# ConsoleLabirinth

console labirinth is a console game in which you have to open all doors on your way out in a randomly generated maze. This is my first c# project, the purpose of which was to get a basic understanding of how to use c# and the net framework.
Doors are identified by a capital letter and colour. The corresponding key is a lowercase letter of the same colour. Peek key first before open the door

# Feauters
